# Open Access Helper for Safari

## Why this document

Protecting your privacy should be your number one concern, when installing a browser extension, like Open Access Helper for Safari. The purpose of this document is to provide you with insight into the code, so that you can be assured that the code itself respects your privacy and indeed only does what I say it does

## What does this App do

Open Access Helper for Safari is a Safari App Extension, which will identify Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) within the page's source code (meta-tags) and then use [unpaywall.org API](https://unpaywall.org) to find a legal Open Access copy for the document you are viewing.

The app will also follow the returned link, which often points to https://dx.doi.org/{DOI} to see whether you might already be at the Open Access version.

## About the code

This app started as a hobby project, I am sure there is plenty in the code that isn't perfect or best practice. If you see something, feel free to open an issue.

## Copyright

I guess there is Copyright and I guess it is mine ;)
